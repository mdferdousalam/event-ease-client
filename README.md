# EventEase Platform  
---

**EventEase** is a simplified event management platform for creating and managing events, registering attendees, and providing real-time updates. The platform includes a backend built with Express and MongoDB, and a frontend developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  

## Features  

### Backend  
1. **User Authentication**  
   - User registration and login with email and password.  
   - Secure API endpoints to restrict event creation and registration to authenticated users.  

2. **Event Management**  
   - Create, update, and delete events.  
   - Each event includes:  
     - Name, date, location, maximum attendees, and creator information.  

3. **Attendee Registration**  
   - API to allow users to register for events, limiting registrations based on maximum attendees.  

4. **Real-time Updates**  
   - Socket.IO for broadcasting:  
     - Notifications when a new attendee registers.  
     - Updates when events are modified or reach maximum capacity.  

### Frontend  
1. **Authentication**  
   - Login and signup pages with user session persistence.  
   - Personalized dashboard displaying events created by the user.  

2. **Event Dashboard**  
   - Display a list of events with the ability to create and register for events.  
   - Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
